      <p class="caption">The internet had been a breeding ground for exploring and developing my creativity. It's been a beacon of expression since I was a kid and has made art very accesbible. From the influence of Youtube to Tumblr to digital archives, it's where the modern day creative documents their existence. </p>

    <h2>Reflection on "The Handmade Web"</h2>
    <p> A website can truly be anything we want it to be. It can be a living room for our thoughts, our creative ideas. It could be a diary, a cookbook, or a blog. That’s the beauty in making a website is that it’s a digital archive of your experiences. With that being said my hopes for the future internet community is that we get back to the roots of craft-like website seen in the early 2000's and use coding as an expression of creativity. I want the internet to continue to be a a way to document who we are, what we experience, an eternal vessel for our art.</p>

  <h2>Touching Grass Site Contrast</h2>
  <p>The "Touching Grass" site serves as a reminder to disconnect from the digital world and immerse oneself in the physical environment. It contrasts the fast-paced, often overwhelming nature of online life with the tranquility and grounding experience of spending time outdoors.</p>
  <p>While the internet offers endless opportunities for connection, learning, and entertainment, it's essential to balance screen time with real-world experiences and interactions. </p>
